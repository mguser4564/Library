# Library
A library project built in JavaScript

This project was a challenge for me, but I enjoyed every minute of it. I'm starting to understand DOM manipulation on a deeper level. The object constructor concept, which was the focus of this project I found quite digestible and interesting. I like how objects work and I am starting to see the bigger picture behind the logic of JavaScript.
